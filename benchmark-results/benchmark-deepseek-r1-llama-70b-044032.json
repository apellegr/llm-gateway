        "content": "Web Workers are a browser API that allows you to run JavaScript code in background threads, separate from the main UI thread. This enables true parallel processing in web applications.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Non-blocking execution**: Heavy computations won't freeze the user interface\n- **True parallelism**: Code runs simultaneously with the main thread\n- **Better performance**: CPU-intensive tasks can be offloaded from the main thread\n\n## Types of Web Workers\n\n### 1. Dedicated Workers\nRun in their own global context and are linked to a single script.\n\n**Main thread (main.js):**\n```javascript\n// Create a new worker\nconst worker = new Worker('worker.js');\n\n// Send data to worker\nworker.postMessage({ command: 'start', data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] });\n\n// Listen for messages from worker\nworker.addEventListener('message', function(e) {\n    console.log('Result from worker:', e.data);\n});\n\n// Handle errors\nworker.addEventListener('error', function(e) {\n    console.error('Worker error:', e);\n});\n```\n\n**Worker thread (worker.js):**\n```javascript\n// Listen for messages from main thread\nself.addEventListener('message', function(e) {\n    const { command, data } = e.data;\n    \n    if (command === 'start') {\n        // Perform heavy computation\n        const result = data.map(num => num * num).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n        \n        // Send result back to main thread\n        self.postMessage(result);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Shared Workers\nCan be accessed by multiple scripts running in different windows/tabs.\n\n```javascript\n// Create or connect to shared worker\nconst worker = new SharedWorker('shared-worker.js');\n\n// Communicate through the port\nworker.port.postMessage('Hello from tab 1');\nworker.port.onmessage = function(e) {\n    console.log(e.data);\n};\n```\n\n## Practical Use Cases\n\n### 1. Data Processing\n```javascript\n// worker.js - Processing large datasets\nself.onmessage = function(e) {\n    const data = e.data;\n    \n    // Heavy data processing\n    const processed = data\n        .filter(item => item.active)\n        .map(item => ({\n            ...item,\n            processed: true,\n            timestamp: Date.now()\n        }))\n        .sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);\n    \n    self.postMessage(processed);\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Image Processing\n```javascript\n// image-worker.js\nself.onmessage = function(e) {\n    const { imageData, filter } = e.data;\n    \n    // Apply image filters without blocking UI\n    for (let i = 0; i < imageData.data.length; i += 4) {\n        if (filter === 'grayscale') {\n            const avg = (imageData.data[i] + imageData.data[i + 1] + imageData.data[i + 2]) / 3;\n            imageData.data[i] = avg;     // Red\n            imageData.data[i + 1] = avg; // Green\n            imageData.data[i + 2] = avg; // Blue\n        }\n    }\n    \n    self.postMessage"
